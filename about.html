<h2>About BaldUncle</h2>

<p>
I use TradingView for my analysis, and have a keen interest in developing scalable, fractal systems to Analyse Charts. <br>I'm quite slow with coding in Pine, so, don't expect 10 indicator scripts a day. I'm planning to go at a snails-pace of 1 indicator script per week or so, until I finish uploading all of my scripts onto TradingView. <br><br>Kindly note that all of my scripts on TradingView will <b>not</b> be open source. Instead, I'll be giving all the code here. <br><br>The way I used to learn Analysis all the years back, before even I got my CMT, was to see Indicators, guess their computation and work on them myself and test them out, before I looked at the solution. That is the idea behind this website.<br><br> If you have any sort of query or complain, feel free to reach out to me anytime here - "balduncle69@gmail.com"
<br>I'll be giving all of my Studies/Strategies' source codes here for all of you to literally copy paste on TradingView, if you want to fork it. Else, all input criteria in all of my scripts are editable although they are not open source on TradingView.
<br><br>This entire project would forever be Open-Source and free for all.
