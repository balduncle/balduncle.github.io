**Hi Children, welcome to my page.**


## Who Am I?

My name is what I am... I'm Bald, and old.
I use TradingView for my analysis, and have a keen interest in developing scalable, fractal systems to Analyse Charts. I'm quite slow with coding in Pine, so, don't expect 10 indicator scripts a day. I'm planning to go at a snails pace of 1 indicator script per week or so, until I finish uploading all of my scripts onto TradingView. Kindly note that all of my scripts on TradingView will not be open source. Instead,I'll be giving all the code here for free. The way I used to learn Analysis all the years back, before even I did my CMT, was to see Indicators, guess their computation and work on them myself and test them out, before I looked at the solution. That is the idea behind this website. If you have any sort of query or complain, feel free to reach out to me anytime here - "balduncle69@gmail.com"


## Usage of this Website
I'll be giving all of my Studies/Strategies' source codes here for all of you to literally copy paste on TradingView, if you want to fork it. Else, all input criteria in all of my scripts are editable although they are not open source on TradingView.

## How to use this website
All studies/strategies posted on my TradingView would be here, with detailed notes, and usage guidelines to ensure you can use it effectively, and make a better iteration of it in the future, to help many more people.

### Posts
Each post here would have links to the original idea published on TradingView, and key observations that Uncle had while devising it, and using it on different kinds of securities.

### Navigation
The list on the right is a key for you to navigate to key topics on each study.

### Light/Dark Mode
There is also a toggle for light/dark mode on the right side.

### Translation
Since I'm pretty bad at writing in different languages, I could manage to integrate Google Translate for those of you who would want to see this page in your own language. For now, I have a few languages only. Do let me know whichever language you'd want on my mail, and, I'll search on google on how to enable that. That surely should be only a line of code somewhere.

### Tags
The tags feature here can be used to collate ideas posted across different types of analysis tools, starting from volatility, momentum, averages, and scalping.(Although, I'd get a slap from Aunt again for a wider Stop Loss, rather than Scalp.)

### Categories
The Categories feature here is to see through all posts here and filter studies/indicators from strategies(either long, short or both), from commentary, from satire and so on.

## Buy me a Coffee
No need. Aunt here makes me great Coffee. This entire project would forever be Open-Source and free for all.
