## 1 | Who Am I?

### Who am I literally?

My name is what I am... I'm Bald, and old.
I'm a real person of course. I'm as real as the governance in your country.

### What are my credentials?

I'm a Market Technician who trades a few million dollars portfolio for a global Trading firm with experience in managing large investor pools of money both within and overseas. I have my own proprietary strategies I use to take advantage of the market, and make sure the odds of winning are on my side.

### Why am I doing this then?

In fact, work is hectic, it always is. But, this has always been my passion. I've loved doing this for over 5 years. Can't stop now can I?

## 2 | What this is

### So is this course a way to learn to trade?

No. People have been trading for ages, since the good ol' age of the Monke.(#RIPHarambe)
I teach people what to see, what not to see, how to see, and why some trades end up being profitable, and how one can lay on the green side of the shrub for the longest possible time.

### What would this course cover?

Here is me being frank - The course is an antithesis to all the BS that you would ever see written on books, websites, videos even by the greatest of the great traders. I'm not saying they're all stupid. But, a lot of opinions are pretty much bullshit, when they can't beat the Index returns annually.
There is a fundamental issue with us all that makes us this way - It is that, our brain sees repeated correlation and assumes causation as the defacto solution. And, when it isn't correlated in the future, because it wasn't supposed to be correlated in the past as well, all hell breaks loose, and traders die a painful death.

### Where did you learn these from?

I had three things going right for me. I had the time, patience, and worked to gather enough money to lose on trades to learn the hard way. I spent hours day and night staring at screens, taking down notes, calculating stuff manually before I learnt to code in stuff. Then, hundreds of weeks of trades, analysis, testing and retesting. I'm not the greatest trader in the world. In fact, i'm pretty sure i'm not even an active trader as I take trades once a week at max. But, that's where I've found my sweet spot. Anyone can be me, or even better than me. I really wish you go leaps and bounds. But, it takes a lot of time to gather these accumulated experience shit-bombs that I'd lambast you with, through the course.
And, best part of all, I always had a career sometimes managing and sometimes trading an investor pool of a few millions of dollars that worked well in giving me enough time to learn all these, by paying my monthly bills.

### What topics would the course exactly cover?
That's the fun part. I hate topics as much as you hate math chapters. The entire course program goes like a big long movie with small parts and sub-parts.
On the topics side, you could name around 30-40 topics starting from money management to derivatives to charting techniques in a statistical sense all the way, to rants that go longer than the bloody english channel.

### Will I be able to make profits trading?
Well, that is the idea. But, on a personal note, if you feel you need to make money, this isn't the course for you. If you are intrigued about this, and want to learn to build a passive income gradually, this is a yes for you.

### What would I be able to do? Intraday?
First thing, the timing is your call. Analysis is pretty much the same, with limited changes wrt what timeframe you apply it to. And, you can also apply this to almost any instrument that is traded. So, this is kinda universal.

## 3 | Why

### Why this program?

There are a Thousand quinquagintaquadringentillion (*I know you skipped the word you cheeky boi*) programs/trading courses out there in the market. And, as much as I'd like to call this one to be different from the other "trading programs", I'm afraid I can't do that.
As I see it, there are ponzi scheme-get-rich-quick-shit-courses that are no better than a guy pulling tarot cards on the side of the street, and real life programs that are built on a pragmatic level.

### How is this any different irl though?
The difference is as simple as this - Where ANY course program would give you a list of steps to supposedly "diagnose" a situation, this course does the opposite. This course program instead tells you the different solutions that are there, how they work and why they work. So, that you can treat a situation like a doctor prescribing medicine, over just dosing on paracetamol for everything because that is the "solution" that some "guru" had taught.

### Will this help?

This program has had good rave reviews, lauding the all round approach that this takes to the study of Technical Analysis through a quantitative route.

The aim of this program is *NOT TO GIVE YOU MY PROFITABLE STRATEGIES* (although i'd be sharing them), but, to *MAKE SURE, YOU CAN DEVELOP YOUR OWN PROFITABLE STRATEGIES.*

The difference is that, when you do something from the scratch, you get a 360 degree understanding, and know what works and why. When the market changes it's mood and direction, you'd know what exactly to do, and would not be left in the lurch.

## 4 | How

### How would the course be delivered?

Previously, there used to be live classes, but, then, for the lack of being able to split them into multiple parts, and making them fun as well, I decided to go through the video route. The course will be available through Youtube Private Playlists.

### What is the fee for the program?
The fee is denominated in INR, although global Paypal is accepted with exceptions (no nigerian prince allowed). The course program comes with a global approach to all stocks/commodities/currencies and even crypto-currencies, albeit with a thick Indian accent. You'd need to get over it. Trust me, some people have told me that they use my voice as ASMR. (Sons of satan probably.)
The fee in INR is 8k, and in USD is $150 adjusted for paypal stealing from us.

### umm... the fee is kinda high... can I get a pirated copy?
I've never cared about pirated copies of this that circulate, as this isn't paying me anything even right now. I don't depend on this for any income, and even if there aren't any takers for the program, I'd continue to roll out updates for the hundreds who had taken the program 4 years back, because this is something I'm passionate about. Nothing else.

So, as far as pirated copies go, you're on your own. I don't track them. There might be some. No Idea.

### Support...?

Around every weekend, I sit down, to look at charts, and try to come up with a new meaningful input/indicator that can make our lives easier. All those would be on this website.

## Things you need to know
### Course Details

The course will try to be decent, but, would lie on borderline explicit because there is just too much stuff that is wrong with the world that we live in.
If you get the course, and just expect it to work on its own, you're an Ass. You need to do all the activities that the course entails, however difficult it might seem to be. The highest mountains made the greatest mountaineers. *(and the most dead bodies. You choose what you want to end up as.)*

### Discounts

Discounts are not given for the same reason promotions aren't done. You either take it or leave it. I'm definitely not even close to being desperate to "sell" more courses to make money. I'm okay with one new taker in an entire year. That one new taker should be a great trader by the end of the year. That's the goal.
