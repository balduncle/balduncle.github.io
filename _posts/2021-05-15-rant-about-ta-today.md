**Hi. I wanted to get this out.**


## The Brain and TA

First of all, you would mostly be wondering what the brain has to do with technical analysis, isn’t technical analysis just meant to be a study of the markets, prices, and to see where the prices would go in the future?
Well… not exactly. Technical analysis is sold like snake oil, being called the cure, and the one single approach to find out where the markets are headed.
But, it definitely isn’t so.

### Science and the Universe
Science says, that all matter in the universe is made of 12 types of particles, and even if we include the energy particles, we come to a paltry 17 which we have theorised and validated till date. And, if one can predict or know, the position and direction of all these 17 particles at all times, theoretically, one would be able to predict what could happen in the future, as everything is the sum result of these 17 particles. **insert Krish future scene**

### Astrology & Brain
But, on a more realistic level, the closest humans ever came to this, was 5000 years ago, when we invented astrology. Now, I’m not stickler… but, if some planet’s relative position, light hours away is going to dictate if you’d get pregnant in the current year, I call it Bullshit.
But, the brain you see, is stupid. It sees something, and expects continuum of sorts.
You see, the markets are the culmination of all buys and sells of thousands of thousands of people and softwares that people designed to exploit inefficiencies among people.

### What TA is and isn't...
So, in essence, TA is an analysis of the collective decisions taken by millions of brains, by one brain (yours). Even the thought of it is atrocious. It’s like trying to sit on a branch, call 100 more to sit on it, and try to measure what the weight of the branch is. There is the difference between effective and ineffective TA.<br>
Since we are trying to find the live wire in the dark to fix our light bulb, there are plenty of methods that you’ll find online, and in books written by even great authors and traders, who spew out stuff that holds no relevance in real world. Some systems are even developed on the basis of astrology! Throughout this course program, I’ll try my best not to bash these systems, as these are, but the unfortunate result of fortune traders, and mis-informed crowds. It is like the set of elders who had black cats crossing them 100 times, and only the 20 bad things that happened stay in their minds, and the other 80 just don’t matter as they are not the part of the notion that is being conveyed.<br><br>What you aim to do with TA, is like finding the optimum slope of a curve with a huge equation with thousands of variables. Agreed, there is a more scientific method to do this, which is to calculate each of the variables, through differentiating the curve and identifying the slope at each and every point, and calculate the acceleration, change of acceleration, the rate of change of acceleration, and the change in that and so on… you can do over 10 orders of derivatives, before the derivatives become so minuscule that they lose significance in a real world application.<br>But, due to the heavy process, even when you use the worlds fastest supercomputer on it… and it is rather not feasible. So, instead, we try to solve the curves visually.

### Brain & Eye
Again, I’m not saying the human brain is better than the world’s best supercomputer. But, I’m saying the human eye is good in analysing visual cues. The effectiveness of the human eye, is a different subject and topic altogether.

But, the crux is that, visual analysis is easier, and quicker than quantitative analysis. <br>I’m pretty sure, I’d have drawn a lot more of skepticism among the scientific community amongst you. Hear me out. Let me give you an example…<br>
Imagine that you keep 10,000 playing card decks - which is 520,000 cards. And, one card among them is flipped face back, and the rest face front. Even with a rudimentary glance, your eyes see the anomaly, and would draw your brain’s attention to it.
Let’s say you keep a million match sticks, perfectly aligned, and parallel to each other, equidistant. If one match stick is slanted, and not parallel, your eye would immediately catch it…The eye would be able to see the angle anomaly despite the huge sample size. But, what if, one match stick isn’t equidistant from it’s neighbour?
The human brain is fascinating in this aspect. And, this is why, to a trained eye, visual cues show much easier. And, it is much easier to train your eyes to identify things, than it is for us to identify all the thousand variables, solve for each of them, calculate the slope of each variable over time, and then project the end result onto a chart. And, we do all that, not knowing what new variable would enter into the mix the next day.

## Mathematical Side
On a mathematic level, the sum of changes of the market can theoretically be brought into a formula, just the same way the entire working of the universe can be theoretically be brought into one Equation, to predict how the future would turn out to be.

I would love to go into the logistic map brought out by the randomness of chaos, and the extreme sensitivity to the inputs that we would assume, but, that would be too long of a diversion from our topic which is as afraid of Mathematics as a 6th grader seeing alphabets instead of numbers for the first time in algebra.

To put things simply, the one equation would yield zillions of probable results, each with its own probability factor, with the passage of time, and trying to change the equation by adding variables and removing them to account for all changes in the past is no guarantee that the equation would serve the purpose of forecasting the future. Like Einstein said in 1933 before neutrons were discovered that Nuclear Bombs were impossible, I say today, that “1 Mathematic equation” is impossible. Probably, we discover a relationship that trumps our current mathematical understanding and gives us a way to navigate the chaos.

## Summary
This entire discussion can be summarised as this - Math would theoretically give you the most accurate results, but, solving the math is improbable at this point in time. The Math is ahead of our times.

Visual cues would give good results to a trained eye, and train it, we will. That is the scientific basis behind TA being an art form. The science is far away. And, although I’ve tried to add concepts of science into this, we are a long way off.

With all that out of the way, and with you having a good understanding of how the brain sees things, we can now get into what TA was supposed to be. We will waste no more time in talking about why TA is the way it is today. There are a lot of shitheads all around you and me, who unfortunately preach TA. Yes, they preach TA. Once upon a time, even I was a preacher. TA was my religion, and I didn’t dare question. But, without question, there is no scientific thought or idea.
